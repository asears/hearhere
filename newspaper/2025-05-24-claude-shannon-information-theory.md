### Early Life and Education

Claude Shannon's journey to Bell Labs began at the University of Michigan, where he studied both electrical engineering and mathematics. His master's thesis at MIT, "A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits," would revolutionize digital circuit design.

**Educational Background**:
- University of Michigan (1936)
  * Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering
  * Bachelor's in Mathematics

- MIT (1937)
  * Master's in Electrical Engineering
  * Doctoral work under Vannevar Bush

## The Bell Labs Years

### Mathematical Research Department

Shannon joined Bell Labs in 1941, where he worked alongside:
- John Pierce (Communications pioneer)
- Harry Nyquist (Sampling theorem)
- Richard Hamming (Error correction)

### The Groundbreaking Paper

In 1948, Shannon published "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," introducing:
1. Binary digits (bits)
2. Channel capacity
3. Entropy of information
4. Error correction
5. Data compression

## Key Concepts

### Information Entropy

Shannon defined information entropy as:
```ascii
H = -∑ p(x) log₂ p(x)
    |
    v
Uncertainty measure
```

This formula revolutionized:
- Data compression
- Error correction
- Cryptography
- Digital storage

### Channel Capacity

The Shannon-Hartley theorem defined:
- Maximum data rate
- Signal-to-noise ratio
- Bandwidth limitations
- Error probability

## Beyond Theory

### Practical Applications

Shannon's work enabled:
1. **Digital Communication**
   - Mobile phones
   - Internet protocols
   - Satellite communications
   - Fiber optics

2. **Data Storage**
   - Error correction codes
   - Compression algorithms
   - Digital media
   - Cloud computing

### Modern Impact
