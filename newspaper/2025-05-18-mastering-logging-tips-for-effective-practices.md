# Modern Python Logging: A Deep Dive into Best Practices

*In today's complex distributed systems, effective logging is more crucial than ever. This article explores modern Python logging practices, with a special focus on OpenTelemetry integration and specialized environments like Jupyter notebooks and Databricks.*

## The Evolution of Logging in Python

Gone are the days when simple print statements were sufficient for debugging. Modern applications demand sophisticated logging solutions that can handle distributed tracing, metrics collection, and contextual information across multiple services. Python's logging ecosystem has evolved to meet these challenges, with OpenTelemetry emerging as a powerful standard for observability.

## Understanding OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTelemetry provides a unified framework for collecting telemetry data - including logs, metrics, and traces. Let's explore how to integrate it into your Python applications:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.trace import Status, StatusCode
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter, BatchSpanProcessor

# Initialize the tracer provider
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Configure the span processor
span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Example usage in a function
@tracer.start_as_current_span("process_data")
def process_data(data):
    try:
        # Your processing logic here
        result = transform_data(data)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error with context
        current_span = trace.get_current_span()
        current_span.set_status(Status(StatusCode.ERROR))
        current_span.record_exception(e)
        raise
```

## Structured Logging in Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks present unique challenges for logging. Here's a pattern that works well in notebook environments:

```python
import logging
from IPython.display import display, HTML

class NotebookHandler(logging.Handler):
    def emit(self, record):
        log_entry = self.format(record)
        style = {
            'DEBUG': 'color: #6c757d',
            'INFO': 'color: #28a745',
            'WARNING': 'color: #ffc107',
            'ERROR': 'color: #dc3545',
            'CRITICAL': 'color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold'
        }
        
        html = f'<div style="{style.get(record.levelname, "")}"><pre>{log_entry}</pre></div>'
        display(HTML(html))

# Configure logger
logger = logging.getLogger('notebook')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logger.addHandler(NotebookHandler())
```

## Databricks Integration

For Databricks environments, we can leverage both OpenTelemetry and MLflow for comprehensive logging:

```python
import mlflow
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

# Configure OpenTelemetry with Databricks metadata
resource = Resource.create({
    "service.name": spark.conf.get("spark.databricks.clusterUsageTags.clusterName"),
    "deployment.environment": spark.conf.get("spark.databricks.clusterUsageTags.environmentName")
})

trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider(resource=resource))

# MLflow integration
mlflow.start_run()
with tracer.start_as_current_span("training_pipeline") as span:
    # Your training code here
    metrics = {"accuracy": 0.95, "loss": 0.1}
    mlflow.log_metrics(metrics)
    span.set_attributes({"ml.metrics": str(metrics)})
```

## Advanced Log Filtering and Sink Management

Modern applications often need to route different types of logs to different destinations. Here's a pattern for implementing sophisticated log routing:

```python
import logging
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
from opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter import AzureLogHandler

class ContextFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        return getattr(record, 'log_to_azure', True)

# Configure handlers
file_handler = RotatingFileHandler('app.log', maxBytes=1024*1024, backupCount=5)
azure_handler = AzureLogHandler(connection_string="your_connection_string")
azure_handler.addFilter(ContextFilter())

# Configure logger
logger = logging.getLogger('app')
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
logger.addHandler(azure_handler)

# Usage example
logger.info("Standard log message")  # Goes to both handlers
logger.info("Local-only message", extra={'log_to_azure': False})  # Only goes to file
```

## Metrics and Baggage: Adding Context to Your Logs

OpenTelemetry's baggage feature allows you to propagate context across service boundaries:

```python
from opentelemetry import baggage
from opentelemetry.trace import set_span_in_context

# Set baggage values
baggage.set_baggage("user.id", "12345")
baggage.set_baggage("deployment.region", "us-west-2")

def process_request():
    # Access baggage in any part of your application
    user_id = baggage.get_baggage("user.id")
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("handle_request") as span:
        span.set_attribute("user.id", user_id)
        # Process the request
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

1. **Log Levels**: Use appropriate log levels consistently:
   - DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
   - INFO: General operational messages
   - WARNING: Indicate a potential issue
   - ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue
   - CRITICAL: The application is about to abort

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Use lazy logging when constructing expensive messages
   - Configure appropriate batch sizes for span processors
   - Implement sampling for high-throughput applications

3. **Context Propagation**:
   - Always propagate trace context across async boundaries
   - Use baggage for business context that needs to flow with the trace
   - Include correlation IDs in all log messages

## Summary

Modern Python logging requires a thoughtful approach that combines traditional logging practices with modern observability tools. By leveraging OpenTelemetry and implementing proper context propagation, you can create a robust logging system that scales with your application's needs.

Remember that effective logging is not just about capturing dataâ€”it's about capturing the right data at the right time and making it accessible when you need it most. The patterns and practices outlined in this article provide a foundation for building maintainable and observable Python applications.
