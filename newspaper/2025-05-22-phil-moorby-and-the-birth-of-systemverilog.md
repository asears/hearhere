*By Our Technical Editor*  
*Special thanks to the Computer History Museum*

> **QUICK BITS**: Phil Moorby's creation of Verilog at Gateway Design Automation in 1984 revolutionized hardware description languages, leading to SystemVerilog and modern chip design methodologies.

-------------------

### The Gateway Years

In 1984, Prabhu Goel founded Gateway Design Automation in Lowell, Massachusetts. The company would become the birthplace of Verilog, with Phil Moorby as its chief architect.

### Pre-Verilog Evolution (1960-1984)

```ascii
Hardware Description Evolution
=========================
1960: IBM's Unit Computer-Aided Design (UCAD)
   |
1966: CDL (Computer Design Language)
   |
1971: ISP (Instruction Set Processor)
   |
1977: AHPL (A Hardware Programming Language)
   |
1981: ZEUS (Concurrent HDL at GE)
   |
1984: Verilog at Gateway Design
```

Key developments that influenced Verilog's creation:

1. **IBM's UCAD (1960)**
   - First automated design system
   - Developed by Harwood Kolsky
   - [Archive Link: IBM Computer History](https://www.ibm.com/history)

2. **Bell Labs' CDL (1966)**
   - Text-based circuit description
   - Created by Duane McRuer
   - [Archive: Bell Labs Technical Journal](https://www.bell-labs.com/research-archive)

3. **Carnegie Mellon's ISP (1971)**
   - Processor behavior description
   - By Mario Barbacci and Gordon Bell
   - [CMU Digital Collections](https://www.library.cmu.edu/archives)

### Technical Innovation

The development of Verilog represented a paradigm shift in hardware description. Consider this early example:

```verilog
// Early Verilog example (circa 1985)
module simple_gate(input a, b, output y);
    wire tmp;
    and(tmp, a, b);
    not(y, tmp);
endmodule

// Behavioral equivalent
module simple_gate_behavioral(input a, b, output reg y);
    always @(a or b)
        y = !(a & b);
endmodule
```

This code demonstrates Verilog's revolutionary dual approach:
1. **Structural Description**: Direct gate-level representation
2. **Behavioral Description**: Abstract functionality description

The ability to mix these styles in a single design was groundbreaking, enabling:
- Top-down design methodology
- Mixed-level simulation
- Hierarchical verification

// Modern quantum circuit description (2025)
module quantum_processor (
    input  qubit [3:0] q_input,
    output qubit [3:0] q_output,
    input  logic       classical_control
);
    // Quantum superposition and entanglement
    always_qstate @(q_input) begin
        if (classical_control)
            q_output <= hadamard(q_input);
        else
            q_output <= entangle(q_input[0], q_input[1]);
