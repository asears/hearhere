# Medallion Architecture in Microsoft Fabric

The medallion architecture is a data design pattern that organizes data into layers of increasing quality and refinement. In Microsoft Fabric, this pattern is particularly well-suited for implementation using Eventhouse and other Fabric services.

## Core Concepts

### Layers

1. **Bronze (Raw)**
   - Raw data ingestion layer
   - Preserves source system data exactly as received 
   - Enables historical reprocessing
   - May contain sensitive data (PII)
   - Primary users: Data Engineers

2. **Silver (Standardized)**
   - Cleaned and conformed data
   - Standardized schema and data types
   - Data quality rules applied
   - Typically anonymized/pseudonymized
   - Users: Data Analysts, Scientists, Engineers

3. **Gold (Business)**
   - Aggregated and enriched data
   - Business metrics and KPIs
   - Optimized for reporting and analytics
   - End-user consumption ready
   - Users: Business Users, Analysts

## Implementation in Fabric

### Eventhouse Implementation

1. **Bronze Layer Features**
   - Continuous ingestion capabilities
   - Raw data storage with ingestion time tracking
   - Support for structured, semi-structured data
   - External table connections to source systems

2. **Silver Layer Features**
   - Update policies for data transformation
   - Data cleaning and standardization
   - Schema evolution handling
   - Delta Lake support for data availability

3. **Gold Layer Features**
   - Materialized views for aggregations
   - Real-time analytics dashboards
   - Business logic implementation
   - Cross-layer data lineage

## Key Benefits

1. **Data Quality**
   - Progressive refinement of data
   - Clear quality gates between layers
   - Validation at each stage

2. **Performance**
   - Optimized storage at each layer
   - Cached aggregations in gold layer
   - Query performance tuning options

3. **Governance**
   - Clear data lineage
   - Access control by layer
   - Audit capabilities

4. **Flexibility**
   - Support for multiple data types
   - Schema evolution handling
   - Multiple consumption patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Data Ingestion**
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
       A[Source Systems] --> B[Bronze Layer]
       B --> C[Silver Layer]
       C --> D[Gold Layer]
       B -.-> E[Archive]
   ```

2. **Layer Management**
   - Implement clear naming conventions
   - Document transformations
   - Monitor data quality metrics
   - Implement appropriate retention policies

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use appropriate indexing strategies
   - Implement partitioning where needed
   - Leverage materialized views
   - Monitor query patterns

## Integration with Fabric Services

- **Lakehouse**: Delta Lake format support
- **Dataflow**: ETL/ELT processes
- **Notebooks**: Custom transformations
- **Power BI**: Direct Lake mode analytics

## Example Structure

```sql
-- Bronze Layer
.create table RawSales (
    SalesId: string,
    Data: dynamic,
    IngestionTime: datetime
)

-- Silver Layer
.create table CleanSales (
    SalesId: string,
    Amount: decimal,
    Date: datetime,
    Customer: string,
    ProcessingTime: datetime
)

-- Gold Layer
.create materialized-view DailySales on table CleanSales {
    CleanSales
    | summarize TotalAmount=sum(Amount) by Date
    | project Date, TotalAmount
}
```
