# Bill C-27 Implementation Playbook

## Executive Summary

This playbook provides a comprehensive guide for organizations to implement Bill C-27 requirements, focusing on privacy protection, AI governance, and data management practices.

## Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

1. **Current State Analysis**
   - Privacy framework assessment
   - AI systems inventory
   - Data protection audit
   - Risk assessment templates

2. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compliance requirements mapping
   - Technical infrastructure evaluation
   - Process documentation review
   - Training needs assessment

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Timeline development
   - Resource allocation
   - Budget planning
   - Stakeholder communication

### Phase 2: Technical Implementation

1. **Privacy Controls**
   ```python
   # Example Privacy Impact Assessment Framework
   class PrivacyImpactAssessment:
       def __init__(self):
           self.risk_levels = ['low', 'medium', 'high']
           self.control_measures = {}
   
       def assess_privacy_risk(self, data_type, processing_purpose):
           # Risk assessment logic
           pass
   
       def implement_controls(self, risk_level):
           # Control implementation
           pass
   ```

2. **AI Governance**
   ```python
   # Example AI System Registration
   class AISystemRegistry:
       def __init__(self):
           self.systems = {}
           self.risk_assessments = {}
   
       def register_system(self, system_id, metadata):
           # Registration logic
           pass
   
       def assess_risk(self, system_id):
           # Risk assessment
           pass
   ```

3. **Data Management**
   ```python
   # Example Data Lifecycle Management
   class DataLifecycleManager:
       def __init__(self):
           self.retention_policies = {}
           self.access_controls = {}
   
       def apply_retention_policy(self, data_type):
           # Retention logic
           pass
   
       def manage_access(self, user_id, data_type):
           # Access control
           pass
   ```

### Phase 3: Organizational Implementation

1. **Policy Development**
   - Privacy policy updates
   - AI governance framework
   - Data handling procedures
   - Incident response plans

2. **Training and Awareness**
   - Employee training programs
