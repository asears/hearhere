## Industry-Specific Applications

### 1. Accounting Applications

#### Transaction Analysis
```sql
-- Example of semantic transaction categorization
SELECT category, confidence
FROM transactions
WHERE semantic.is_true(
    description,
    'Identify if this is a business expense',
    model => 'gpt-4.1'
);
```

#### Financial Pattern Detection
```sql
-- Vector similarity for fraud detection
SELECT t.* 
FROM transactions t
WHERE vector_similarity(
    t.pattern_vector,
    (SELECT pattern_vector FROM known_fraud_patterns)
) > 0.85;
```

#### Use Cases
- Automated audit trail analysis
- Intelligent expense categorization
- Fraud pattern detection
- Compliance monitoring

### 2. Finance Applications

#### Market Analysis
```sql
-- Semantic market sentiment analysis
SELECT semantic.generate(
    'Summarize market sentiment',
    content => market_news,
    model => 'gpt-4.1'
)
FROM financial_news
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

#### Risk Assessment
```sql
-- Vector-based risk profiling
WITH risk_factors AS (
    SELECT vector_agg(risk_vector) AS combined_risk
    FROM customer_profiles
)
SELECT client_id, similarity_score
FROM client_risk_vectors
CROSS JOIN risk_factors
WHERE vector_similarity(risk_vector, combined_risk) > 0.7;
```

#### Use Cases
- Real-time risk assessment
- Portfolio optimization
- Market sentiment analysis
- Regulatory compliance checking

### 3. Retail Applications

#### Customer Behavior Analysis
```sql
-- Graph-based customer journey analysis
MATCH (c:Customer)-[p:PURCHASED]->(i:Item)
WHERE semantic.is_true(
    i.description,
    'Premium product category',
    model => 'gpt-4.1'
)
RETURN c.segment, count(p) as premium_purchases;
```

#### Inventory Optimization
```sql
-- Smart inventory prediction
SELECT 
    product_id,
    semantic.generate(
        'Predict stock requirements',
        context => sales_history,
        model => 'gpt-4.1'
    ) as stock_prediction
FROM inventory_data;
```

#### Use Cases
- Personalized recommendations
- Dynamic pricing optimization
- Supply chain optimization
- Customer segmentation

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Query Optimization
```sql
-- Example of semantic query optimization
CREATE INDEX vector_idx ON products 
USING diskann (product_features)
WITH (
    dimensions = 1536,
    max_elements = 1000000,
    ef_construction = 400
);
```

### 2. Resource Management
```sql
-- Example of resource allocation
ALTER SYSTEM SET 
    maintenance_work_mem = '2GB',
    effective_cache_size = '24GB',
    shared_buffers = '8GB';
```

## Security Implementation

### 1. Data Protection
```sql
-- Example of row-level security
CREATE POLICY data_access_policy ON customer_data
    USING (semantic.is_true(
        access_level,
        'User has required permissions',
        model => 'gpt-4.1'
    ));
```

### 2. Access Control
```sql
-- Role-based access with semantic verification
CREATE ROLE analyst WITH
    semantic.verify_access(
        'Data analyst role permissions',
        context => role_requirements,
        model => 'gpt-4.1'
    );
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Vector-based performance analysis
SELECT 
    query_id,
    semantic.analyze(
        execution_stats,
        'Identify performance bottlenecks',
        model => 'gpt-4.1'
    ) as performance_insights
FROM pg_stat_statements;
```

### 2. Health Checks
```sql
-- Automated health assessment
SELECT semantic.generate(
    'Database health analysis',
    context => system_metrics,
    model => 'gpt-4.1'
) as health_report
FROM system_statistics;
```
